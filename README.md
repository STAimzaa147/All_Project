## Pac-Man-like Game: A simple game inspired by the classic Pac-Man.
In Pac-Man, players control Pac-Man, a yellow character navigating a maze to eat all the dots while avoiding four colorful ghosts. The goal is to clear the maze of dots, with the added challenge of ghosts that chase Pac-Man. There are also some fruits that give more points. Eating larger Power Pellets temporarily makes Pac-Man go berserk, allowing Pac-Man to eat the ghosts for extra points. Pac-Man loses a life if caught by a ghost, and the game ends when all lives are lost. Players must strategize to clear the maze and avoid getting trapped by the ghosts.
